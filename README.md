# Fraud Detection on Bank Payments

## Overview

The **Fraud Detection on Bank Payments** project aims to identify fraudulent transactions in bank payment data using machine learning techniques. By analyzing transaction data, this project detects patterns and anomalies that indicate potential fraud. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation, providing insights into transaction behavior and fraud risk.

## Purpose

In the financial sector, accurately detecting fraudulent transactions is crucial for minimizing losses and ensuring customer trust. This project serves to:

- **Identify Fraudulent Transactions**: Predict which transactions are likely to be fraudulent, allowing for proactive fraud prevention measures.
- **Enhance Security Measures**: Provide data-driven insights to inform security protocols and transaction monitoring systems.
- **Support Financial Institutions**: Assist banks and payment processors in optimizing their fraud detection systems.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values and outliers.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze transaction data using visualizations to understand fraud patterns.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features based on existing data to improve model performance.
- **Model Training**: Implement various machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to predict fraudulent transactions.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and ROC-AUC curves.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **XGBoost**
- **Imbalanced-learn**

# Fraud Detection System for Banking Transactions

## Project Overview
This system detects potentially fraudulent financial transactions using machine learning techniques. It analyzes patterns in synthetic payment data from the Banksim dataset, which simulates real-world customer transactions across different time periods and payment amounts.

## Detailed Features
1. **Anomaly Detection**
   - Implements Isolation Forest algorithm to identify unusual transactions
   - Uses Local Outlier Factor for spatial clustering of suspicious activities
   - Custom thresholding for fraud probability scores

2. **Transaction Analysis**
   - Time-based features: Frequency of transactions per hour/day
   - Amount analysis: Deviation from typical transaction amounts
   - Location patterns: Unusual geographic transaction sequences

3. **Visual Analytics**
   - Interactive dashboards showing fraud hotspots
   - Time-series visualization of suspicious activity
   - Alert system for operations teams
